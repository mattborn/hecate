# hecate
[The Greek Goddess of Magic.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hecate) Also a hack day project.

- [x] Bookmarklet
- [x] Chrome Extension
- [ ] No need for this because it’s coded in the product

## UI Themes

~For our first trick, multi-product UI themes.~

~Load the bookmarklet and new options for themes will magically appear. ✨~

> Update: Themes were the focus for the Q3 Hack Day. For the Q4 Hack Day, I am repurposing this project something more useful in our Zeus product—a presence system.

## TODO List

Run `live-server --port=1666` & execute `localStorage.setItem('chui', JSON.stringify({src: 'http://localhost:1666'}))` in console to dev locally.

- [x] Loop & load external scripts
- [x] Support email-based accounts with Firebase
